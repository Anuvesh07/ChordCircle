## � What iis ChordCircle?

> _"We're taking our first steps toward solving music fragmentation across platforms"_

ChordCircle is our attempt at creating a music platform integration tool that could help connect Spotify, Apple Music, and other streaming services. We're just getting started on this journey and learning as we go!

### � Thee Story Behind the Name
